Plan: AI-Powered FRA Atlas & WebGIS Decision Support System — SIH 2025/26
TL;DR — Build "VanAdhikar Drishti" (Forest Rights Vision) — a unified national digital platform hosted on NIC MeghRaj that ingests and digitizes legacy FRA documents via AI-OCR, renders an interactive FRA Atlas with satellite-derived asset maps on a WebGIS portal, and serves a DSS engine that cross-links FRA patta holders with CSS scheme eligibility. Eight distinct role-based web interfaces are designed with an Indian government aesthetic rooted in tribal art, forest tones, and Indic typography — built for offline-capable field usage all the way to national-level policy dashboards. Focus states: Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Odisha, Telangana.

Module 1 — AI-Powered Data Digitization Pipeline
Input: Scanned legacy FRA documents — Form A (IFR claims), Form B (CR claims), Form C (CFR claims), rejection orders, patta certificates — from 4 states in Hindi, Odia, Telugu, and regional tribal scripts.

Step 1 — Document Ingestion:

Bulk upload interface with drag-and-drop; accepts PDF, JPEG, TIFF
Auto-categorizes document type using a fine-tuned DistilBERT classifier
Progress bar with batch status per district/block
Step 2 — OCR Engine:

Primary: PaddleOCR v4 (multilingual; Hindi/Devanagari, Odia, Telugu)
Fallback: Tesseract 5.x with custom Gondi/Santhali language packs
For handwritten text: TrOCR (Microsoft, fine-tuned on Indian handwritten datasets)
Pre-processing: OpenCV deskew, binarization, noise removal, contrast enhancement
Output: Raw text + bounding box coordinates saved to MongoDB
Step 3 — NER Extraction:

Model: IndicNER (AI4Bharat) fine-tuned specifically on FRA document corpus
Entities extracted:
Patta holder name (primary + family)
Village name, Gram Sabha
District / Block / State
Khasra / Survey number
Claim ID (IFR/CR/CFR)
Area in acres/hectares
Claim status (Received / Verified / Approved / Rejected)
Date of filing / Date of decision
GPS coordinates (if present)
Confidence score attached to each entity
Low-confidence fields flagged for human review via a QA queue
Step 4 — Data Standardization:

Fuzzy-match village names against official LGD (Local Government Directory) codes
Normalize area units, date formats
Deduplicate records using Levenshtein distance on claimant name + Khasra + village
Output: Structured JSON → ingested into PostgreSQL FRA master table with full audit trail
Step 5 — Human-in-the-Loop QA Interface:

Displays original scanned image alongside extracted data
Officers correct, confirm, or reject entity tags
Corrections fed back as fine-tuning data for continuous model improvement

Module 2 — Interactive FRA Atlas (WebGIS)
Base Map Options:

ISRO Bhuvan satellite tiles (default — India-specific, high res)
OpenStreetMap (fallback)
ESRI World Imagery (premium layer option)
Revenue/Cadastral map overlay (from state land records portals via WMS)
Spatial Layers Stack (toggle-able):

Layer	Source	Format
State/District/Block/Village admin boundaries	Census 2011 + LGD	GeoJSON/PostGIS
IFR patta boundaries (individual)	State FRA cells + digitized data	Shapefile → PostGIS
CFR/CR boundaries	State Forest Depts	Shapefile → PostGIS
Forest Survey of India forest cover	FSI biennial report	Raster/WMS
Revenue cadastral maps (Khasra)	State land record portals	WMS API
AI-detected farmland	Satellite CV output	GeoTIFF overlay
AI-detected water bodies	Satellite CV output	Vector +GeoTIFF

WebGIS Interactions:

Click any village polygon → slide-up panel shows FRA stats, asset inventory, scheme coverage, gap analysis
Draw tool: officers can sketch new claim boundaries and submit for review
Measure tool: area and perimeter calculation for CFR boundaries
Time-slider: animate patta grant progress from 2006 → present year
Heatmap mode: density of claims received vs. granted per district
Compare mode: split-screen before/after satellite images (2-year intervals)
Export: download selected area as PDF report, shapefile, or CSV
Module 3 — AI-Based Satellite Asset Mapping
Satellite Data Source: Sentinel-2 (ESA Copernicus, 10m resolution, free API) + optional Resourcesat-2 (ISRO Bhuvan) for India-specific high-res imagery.

Computer Vision Pipeline:
Raw Satellite Tiles (GeoTIFF)
    ↓  [GDAL preprocessing — clip to village boundary]
    ↓  [Radiometric calibration + band compositing]
    ↓  [U-Net Semantic Segmentation Model]
         Classes: Agricultural land | Dense forest | 
                  Degraded forest | Water body |
                  Homestead/settlement | Bare land | 
                  Plantation | Scrubland
    ↓  [Post-processing: morphological ops, min-area filter]
    ↓  [Vectorization: raster → GeoJSON polygons]

Computed quarterly from Sentinel-2 Band 8 (NIR) + Band 4 (RED)
NDVI < 0.2 → alert for forest degradation in CFR zones
NDVI trend over 3 years → "forest health score" per CFR village
Water Body Detection:

NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) for pond/stream detection
Alert system: seasonal water bodies disappearing → triggers Jal Shakti scheme flag in DSS
Additional Data Layers:

Forest cover change (deforestation alerts): Google Earth Engine API for annual change detection
Groundwater data: CGWB district-level depth to water table
Infrastructure gaps: PM Gati Shakti layer (schools, hospitals, roads within 5 km radius of village)
Soil data: ICAR Soil Health Card API integration for agricultural recommendations
Module 4 — Decision Support System (DSS) Engine
Core Logic — Eligibility Matrix:

For every FRA patta holder village, the DSS evaluates 25+ parameters and outputs a ranked list of recommended CSS interventions.

Rule-Based Layer (deterministic):

Trigger Condition	Recommended Scheme	Ministry
IFR patta granted + no PM-KISAN enrollment	PM-KISAN (₹6000/yr)	MoA
Water body index low + CGWB depth > 10m	Borewell under Jal Shakti Abhiyan	MoJSWS
CFR village + NDVI declining	Van Dhan Vikas Kendra setup	MoTA
No pucca house in village + FRA title held	PMAY-G (Grameen)	MoRD
MGNREGA job card not issued to patta holders	MGNREGA enrollment drive	MoRD
School > 5 km away	EMRS / Eklavya school	MoTA
No Anganwadi within 3 km	ICDS center	MoWCD
Unelectrified households	SAUBHAGYA / DDUGJY	MoP
No telecom connectivity	BharatNet Phase 3	MoC
PVTG community FRA village	PM-JANMAN all 11 interventions	MoTA
AI-Enhanced Layer (ML scoring):

XGBoost model trained on historical scheme uptake data to predict which villages have highest unmet demand
Multi-label classification: each village gets probability scores for top-5 most needed interventions
"Saturation Score" (0–100%) per village = % of applicable schemes with active beneficiaries
Villages with saturation < 40% flagged as "Priority Intervention Zones" on the Atlas map
Gap Analysis Engine:

Pulls real-time data from PM-KISAN API, JJM IMIS, MGNREGA MIS
Compares FRA patta holder count with enrolled beneficiary count per scheme
Generates gap report: "X patta holders in village Y are eligible for PM-KISAN but not enrolled"
One-click escalation: generates official communication draft to relevant line department
DA-JGUA Dashboard Integration:

Maps all 25 DA-JGUA interventions against FRA villages in the 4 focus states
Tracks physical and financial progress per intervention per block
Shows convergence potential: overlays DA-JGUA gaps with FRA patta distribution

Interactive atlas: show district-level choropleth switching between IFR granted %, NDVI health, and scheme gap maps
DSS: enter a village → show eligibility matrix → click "generate gap report" → PDF downloads
Role switch: log in as Range Officer on mobile → log in as Collector on desktop, same data flow
Post-Deployment Metrics:

OCR accuracy ≥ 92% on standard FRA forms (measured against human QA)
NER F1 score ≥ 0.85 on entity extraction benchmark
Satellite land-use classification accuracy ≥ 88% (vs. ground truth)
WebGIS map load time ≤ 3 seconds on 4G
DSS scheme recommendation acceptance rate (tracked via feed)
Decisions
Atlas name chosen: "VanAdhikar Drishti" (Forest Rights Vision) — evocative, bilingual-friendly, brand-able
Satellite source: ESA Sentinel-2 (free, 10m, 5-day revisit) over commercial MAXAR/Planet to stay within zero-budget for college team
GIS client: Leaflet.js + MapLibre GL over ArcGIS Online — fully open source, NIC-hostable, zero licensing
OCR: PaddleOCR primary for Indic script superiority over Tesseract alone; TrOCR for handwritten
Auth: Keycloak over Firebase Auth — required for GOI Jan Parichay compatibility
State branding: Each state portal has a sub-theme color overlay (MP: orange; Odisha: maroon; Tripura: olive; Telangana: teal) while keeping the national design system intact
No commercial maps (Google Maps): Bhuvan (ISRO) as primary base map — mandatory for sensitive forest boundary data on government platforms
